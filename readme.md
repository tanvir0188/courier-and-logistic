## 🚀 Project Idea Hub

> A collection of real-world, backend-heavy project ideas for **you** to build meaningful full-stack applications.

**You** should treat them as **starting points**, then define **your** own requirements, database design, APIs, business rules, and additional features.

## 🧭 How to Use This Hub

For your chosen idea, define:

1. Requirement Anlysis with AI
2. Users and roles
3. Core problem and solution
4. Main workflows
5. Database entities and relationships
6. Business rules
7. Authentication and authorization
8. Transaction boundaries
9. Caching strategy
10. Admin operations
11. Analytics and reporting
12. Important edge cases

The listed features are suggestions, **not fixed requirements**. You can add, remove, combine, or redesign them.

# 🧠 General Guidelines

A strong project should focus on solving a real problem rather than simply demonstrating CRUD operations.

Consider adding relevant features such as:

- Authentication and RBAC
- Multi-tenancy
- Complex PostgreSQL relationships
- Database indexing
- Transactions
- State machines / status workflows
- Redis caching
- Rate limiting
- Background jobs
- Email notifications
- File uploads
- Search and filtering
- Audit logs
- Analytics
- Reports
- Scheduling
- Matching algorithms
- Location-based functionality
- Resource allocation
- Payments where appropriate

> **Do not add a feature just because a technology exists in the stack.** Every feature should have a meaningful purpose in the chosen domain.

## 🌟 Final Goal

The goal is not to build the largest application possible.

The goal is to build a system where the:

**Problem → Requirements → Architecture → Database Design → Business Logic → API Design → Engineering Decisions**

all make sense together.

**You** are encouraged to make each project **your** own.
